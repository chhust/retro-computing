# Retro Computing Experiments

---

All these codes were written in the context of the DFG-funded research project _Cultures of Home Computer Music_ at the University of Music and Theatre in Leipzig, Germany.

None of them is truly finished, some are simple sketches, others are abandoned side quests, and all are stored for documentation and as a private archive rather than for their non-existent glory. :)

Currently, the repository contains:

+ `6502-emulator`: Some Portions of an unfinished 6502 emulator, written in C and Python, with some really rough ideas how to implement an ALU emulation at transistor level (currently, gate level) as well
+ `basic-graphics-commands`: An implementation or re-invention of some commands from Commodore BASIC V3.5
+ `postfix-converter`: A converter to postfix with some elementary variable handling, meant as an experiment with a core part of an interpreter design
+ `ted-demo`: A demo program to show the sound capabilities of Commodore's commercial flop, the 264 computer series

---

Codes not yet uploaded are:

+ An experiment in arpeggio creation on the C16 in BASIC
+ Some experiments with waveform creation on an AMIGA.

---

As written before, more a convoluted playground than a product. Anyone interested in retro chips, weird register control, low-level graphics, or the aesthetics of 1980s computing, feel free to tinker around.
