6502 ARITHMETIC-LOGIC UNIT EMULATION
====================================

This code is a gate-level emulation of the ADC (add with carry) function, adding two numbers.
Below gate-level, transistors are already defined for a future descent one level down.
Gates are represented as nodes in a graph structure, with edges representing tracks.

Most of this is done from scratch, with some magic black-box like parts still left where I actually only simulate
outcomes, not actual mechanics.

For the microelectronics parts (the deeper levels), I used two books:
+ the more technical and extensive "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by David Money Harris and Sarah L.
  Harris (2nd ed., Burlington: Morgan Kaufmann, 2012),
+ and the super-accessible "CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" by Charles Petzold (I used
  the German translation, "CODE: Wie Computer funktionieren", 2nd ed., Frechen: mitp, 2023).

I took my ideas about the processor from the 6502 documentation and literature, mostly from the wonderful book by
+ Rodnay Zaks, "Programming the 6502" that includes some technical overview data as well (again, I used a German
  translation: "Programmierung des 6502", 3rd ed., DÃ¼sseldorf: Sybex, 1982).
